# Deploy

You can deploy your Ponder app to any cloud environment that supports Node.js.

- [Railway](#railway)
- [Self-hosting](#self-hosting)

## Railway

[Railway](https://railway.app)'s general-purpose cloud platform is a great starting point for most Ponder apps.

<Steps>

### Log in to Railway

Connect your GitHub account, and make sure that your Ponder app has been pushed to remote.

### Create a Ponder app service

From the Railway console:

1. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** and select your repo from the list
2. Click **Add variables**, then add RPC URLs (e.g. `PONDER_RPC_URL_1`) and other environment variables
3. Create a public domain. In **Settings** → **Networking**, click **Generate Domain** 
4. Set the healthcheck path and timeout. In **Settings** → **Deploy**, set the **Healthcheck Path** to `/ready` and the **Healthcheck Timeout** to `86400` seconds (1 day)

<Callout type="warning">
  _Monorepo users:_ Configure the **Root Directory** and **Start Command**
  such that `ponder start` runs at the Ponder project root. For example, set the root
  directory to `packages/ponder` or set the start command to `cd packages/ponder
  && pnpm start`.
</Callout>

### Create a Postgres database

From the new project dashboard:

1. Click **Create** → **Database** → **Add PostgreSQL**
2. Open the **Variables** tab for the Ponder app service, click **New Variable** → **Add Reference** → select `DATABASE_URL` and click **Add**

After a moment, the Ponder app service should redeploy successfully. Check the **Build Logs** and **Deploy Logs** tabs to debug any issues.

</Steps>

## Self hosting

In general, hosting a Ponder app is similar to hosting a normal Node.js HTTP server. Rather than offer a step-by-step guide, this section describes the key Ponder-specific quirks to consider when self-hosting.

### Database connection

<Callout type="warning">
  You app will have performance issues if the roundtrip database latency exceeds ~20 milliseconds. This is common when using a database in different private network or region.
</Callout>

In production, Ponder works best with a Postgres database in the same private network. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the connection string of your Postgres database, or manually override the `database.connectionString` option in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {6}
import { createConfig } from "@ponder/core";

export default createConfig({
  database: {
    kind: "postgres",
    connectionString: "postgres://user:password@mycloud.internal:5432/database",
  },
  // ... more config
});
```

### Table names and live views

When a Ponder app starts up, it creates user tables (defined in `ponder.schema.ts`) in the target schema. To avoid naming conflicts with other Ponder apps or previous instances of the current app, onchain tables are prefixed with an unique four character ID.

In order to support zero-downtime redeployments, the `0.7` release reintroduced the concept of "live views". Live views: are created once an app completes its historical backfill. They don't use any naming prefixes and point to the "live", or most recently healthy, tables.
- are created once an app completes its historical backfill
- don't use naming prefixes
- point to the most

#### Example

Here's a zero-downtime scenario, where views continously serve live data:
1. App with `instance_id: 1234` creates and uses `1234__account` table
2. App with `instance_id: 1234` completes the historical backfill, creates `account` view that points to `1234__account`
3. App with `instance_id: 5678` creates and uses `5678__account` table
4. App with `instance_id: 5678` completes the historical backfill, replaces `account` with a view that points to `5678__account`

<Callout type="info">
  In some cases, it may be useful to change the target schema. [Read more](/docs/schema).
</Callout>

### Crash recovery

Ponder apps support shutting down and resuming the previous progress without reindexing.

### Health checks & probes

<Callout type="info">
  The `0.6` release added the `/ready` endpoint and simplified `/health`. Read the [migration guide](/docs/migration-guide#060).
</Callout>

Use the `/health` and `/ready` endpoints to configure health checks or [probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

- **`/health`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response immediately after the process starts.
- **`/ready`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response once indexing progress has reached realtime across all chains. During the historical backfill, the endpoint returns an HTTP `503` response.
